# Twitch Stream Panel
### (Formerly NOPAN & Friends Twitch Status)
#### Support: https://discord.gg/YEZkpkj

### Quick Rundown
#### What?
BetterDiscord plugin that fetches a few streams from the Twitch API and displays them in a small table with a viewcounter if ever online. Uses member colors from [Better Role Colors](https://github.com/rauenzi/BetterDiscordAddons/tree/master/Plugins/BetterRoleColors) if possible.

#### How?
Open the [latest](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Orrielel/BetterDiscordAddons/master/Plugins/StreamPanel/StreamPanel.plugin.js) version and save the file in the BetterDiscord plugins folder (Right-click, save page as. Right-clicking the link also works). You can reach the folder either with the shortcut in the plugin list overview, or by pasting this into the explorer navigation line `%appdata%\BetterDiscord\plugins`. Make sure the filename is `StreamPanel.plugin.js`.

Obviously requires [BetterDiscord](https://github.com/jiiks/betterdiscordapp) installed.

#### And?
PM if you want add -- for a gentle 5â‚¬ fee :^)
